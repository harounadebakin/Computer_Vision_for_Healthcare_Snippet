# ðŸ§  Computer Vision for Medical Imaging  
## Replicating a CNN for Brain Tumor Classification (Present or Absent)

### ðŸ“– Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Computer Vision in the healthcare domain by building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images as either *tumor present* or *tumor absent*.  
The architecture replicates the TinyVGG model, inspired by [Polo Clubâ€™s CNN Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/).  
The project showcases how PyTorch can be used to develop, train, and evaluate deep learning models for medical imaging tasks.

### ðŸ§© Objectives
- Implement a CNN (TinyVGG) from scratch using PyTorch  
- Classify MRI brain scans into two categories: YES (tumor present) and NO (tumor absent)  
- Visualize training data and model predictions  
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and loss metrics
